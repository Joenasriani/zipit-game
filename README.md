ZIP IT! - LINKEDIN GAME PRACTICE
DEVELOPED BY JOE NASR (ROBOMARKET)

OVERVIEW
ZIP IT! is a premium, high-performance logic puzzle designed to help users master the grid-coverage mechanics found in popular professional networking games. Engineered with mathematical precision, the game challenges players to find Hamiltonian paths across various 6x6 grid configurations.

CORE MECHANICS

START: Begin your path at the circular node labeled 1.

ZIP: Drag your cursor or finger to connect every single square on the 36-cell grid.

SEQUENCE: You must pass through numbered checkpoints in their correct numerical order.

FINISH: The level is only complete when 100% of the grid is covered and you end precisely on the final numbered node.

PREMIUM FEATURES

SPEED STREAKS: Fast zipping triggers momentum rewards like FAST!, ZIPPY!, and FLOW!.

CELEBRATION ENGINE: Custom confetti bursts celebrate every successful 100% zip.

HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Subtile scaling and "pop" animations provide tactile visual responses.

BOSS LEVEL: Level 29 features a special "Mastery" glow for the ultimate challenge.

INTELLIGENT ERROR HANDLING: If you finish without covering the full grid, the board shakes and missed squares flash red to guide your next attempt.
